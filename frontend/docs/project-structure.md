# Folders

## Components

An object is only a component if it only uses data through its `props`, but cannot grab data from external sources (stores, context, API, environment variables)

`/components/generic`

Only generic, re-usable components may be placed in this folder. Components must be generic enough that they do not hold any business context and may work in other projects out of the box. (eg. Buttons, Toggles, Carousels, etc.)

`/components/business`

Re-usable components which are used multiple times within the scope of this project may be placed in this folder.

# Naming
